# Flight Log Entry (Admin)

Use **Logbook / Flight log entry** for spreadsheet-style flight corrections and reconciliation.

## Typical use cases

- Correct meter values after discrepancies
- Add/adjust oil and landing counts
- Resolve date/pilot metadata issues
- Clean up partial or malformed entries

## Workflow

1. Select active club context.
2. Filter/sort to locate target rows.
3. Edit inline fields.
4. Save row-level changes.
5. Validate resulting calculations.

## Safety checks before save

- End values must not be less than start values.
- Edit only fields you can verify from source records.
- Keep discrepancy flags accurate for auditability.

## When to use instead of pilot edits

- Historical reconciliation across many rows
- Operations/admin corrections for club reporting
- Post-maintenance bookkeeping updates
