# Messaging (Admin)

Use **Messaging** for club-wide broadcasts.

## Delivery channels

You can send to one or both:

- **Push notifications** to active member devices
- **Comms feed** posting for in-app visibility

## Broadcast workflow

1. Open **Messaging**.
2. Enter title (optional).
3. Enter message body.
4. Choose delivery channels.
5. Send broadcast.

## Best practices

- Keep messages short and action-focused.
- Use clear effective dates/times.
- Post to feed for persistent visibility, even when push is enabled.
