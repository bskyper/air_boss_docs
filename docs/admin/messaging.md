# Messaging (Admin)

Use **Messaging** for club-wide broadcasts.

## Delivery channels

You can send to one or both:

- **Push notifications** to active member devices
- **Comms feed** posting for in-app visibility

Use both channels for operational notices that must be seen quickly and also remain visible later.

## Broadcast workflow

1. Open **Messaging**.
2. Enter title (optional).
3. Enter message body.
4. Choose delivery channels.
5. Send broadcast.

Expected result:

- Push path reports member/device delivery counts.
- Comms path posts a timeline message in the active club feed.

## Recommended Message Template

- First line: what changed
- Second line: who it affects
- Third line: effective date/time
- Final line: required action and contact

Example:

- `Runway closure update`
- `Affects all pilots at KPAO`
- `Effective Saturday 08:00–14:00`
- `Use alternate departure procedure; contact dispatch for questions`

## Best practices

- Keep messages short and action-focused.
- Use clear effective dates/times.
- Post to feed for persistent visibility, even when push is enabled.

## If Something Fails

### Push send reports partial failure

- Re-send with concise content.
- Keep comms feed enabled so message remains visible even if push misses devices.

### Message posted to wrong audience

- Confirm active club selector before sending.
- Post a correction immediately with clear subject prefix: `Correction:`.

### Send button disabled

- Ensure body has content.
- Ensure at least one channel is enabled.
