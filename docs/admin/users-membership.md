# Users and Membership

Use **Users** to manage active members and pending approvals.

## Main views

- **Members** — active/inactive members, roles, docs summary
- **Pending** — applicants awaiting approval

## Pending Approval Workflow

1. Open **Users** and switch to **Pending**.
2. Review applicant profile and document readiness.
3. Approve valid applicants quickly.
4. Reject or defer applications missing required compliance data.

Expected result:

- Approved members move to active members view.
- Pending counts decrease.

## Admin actions

- Approve pending members
- Activate/deactivate membership
- Promote/demote role
- Review document status and expiration
- Manage per-aircraft approvals where configured

## Member Status and Role Workflow

1. Open member row/details.
2. Change status:
   - Active
   - Inactive
3. Change role when required:
   - Member
   - Admin (or role model used by your club)
4. Save and confirm role/status indicators update.

## Document Review Workflow

1. Sort/filter for expired or expiring docs.
2. Open member detail.
3. Verify file quality, document type, and expiration date.
4. Mark as verified or request re-upload.

## Aircraft Approval Workflow

Where enabled, use member detail to set aircraft-specific approvals.

Recommended use:

- Restrict to aircraft requiring checkout/authorization.
- Keep approvals current after recurrent training or policy changes.

## Data points to monitor

- Pending approvals count
- Expired/expiring documents
- Inactive members needing reactivation

## Operational guidance

- Approve or deny quickly to avoid onboarding delays.
- Resolve document expirations before booking-critical dates.
- Keep role assignments minimal and intentional.

## If Something Fails

### Member cannot be activated

- Confirm membership exists for the active club (not another club).
- Confirm no unresolved pending/penalty state.

### Role changes are not reflected

- Refresh users page.
- Re-open member row to confirm persisted role.
- Verify you are in the correct active club context.

### Pending list looks stale

- Use browser refresh.
- Recheck active club selector.
