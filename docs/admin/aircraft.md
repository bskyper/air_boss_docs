# Aircraft Management (Admin)

Use admin **Aircraft** for fleet lifecycle management.

## Core actions

- Add new aircraft
- Edit aircraft profile and status
- Configure billing method/rate behavior
- Update maintenance fields and due dates
- Remove aircraft when needed

## Data quality checklist

- Tail number, make/model/year are complete
- Current meter values are accurate
- Status reflects operational reality (airworthy/grounded/etc.)
- Document links (POH/W&B/cheat sheet) are valid

## Why this matters

Aircraft settings directly affect:

- Pilot booking eligibility
- Flight-log validation behavior
- Billing calculations
- Maintenance warnings shown to pilots
