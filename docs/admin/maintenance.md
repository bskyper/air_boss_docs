# Maintenance and Squawks (Admin)

Use admin **Maintenance** to triage and close squawk workflows.

## Board structure

Squawks are grouped by status lanes (reported/open/in-progress/resolved style states).

Each card typically includes:

- Squawk number and summary
- Tail number and club context
- Priority/category
- Reporter and timestamps
- Comments and photo attachments (if provided)

## Admin workflow

1. Filter to open and high-priority items.
2. Confirm aircraft impact and grounding needs.
3. Add internal updates/comments.
4. Move to resolved/closed when complete.
5. Verify operational status before returning aircraft to service.

## Best practices

- Treat grounded/critical items as same-day priorities.
- Keep comment history concise and actionable.
- Link maintenance scheduling blocks to major squawks to prevent booking overlap.
