# Reservations Control

Use admin **Schedule** to manage club-wide reservation operations.

## Before You Make Changes

- Confirm active club in header selector.
- Confirm date window and view mode (timeline/list).
- Check pending approvals and maintenance hold counts first.

## Views and controls

- Timeline or list view
- Day-range window controls
- Date navigation (previous/today/next)
- Club-scoped context from active club selector

## What admins can do

- Create new reservation blocks
- Edit existing reservations
- Cancel reservations
- Add maintenance blocks directly on schedule
- Monitor pending approvals and maintenance holds

## Create/Edit Reservation Workflow

1. Open schedule and choose timeline view for conflict visibility.
2. Click empty slot or reservation block.
3. Select aircraft, start/end times, and purpose.
4. Save changes.
5. Confirm block appears in expected row/time.

## Maintenance Hold Workflow

1. Create reservation block for maintenance status.
2. Use clear purpose text (inspection/repair/annual/etc.).
3. Confirm pilots can no longer reserve that slot.
4. Remove or update hold when maintenance is complete.

## Recommended workflow

1. Set active club.
2. Select time range and date window.
3. Review pending and maintenance counts.
4. Resolve conflicts before creating new blocks.
5. Use maintenance blocks to reserve downtime and avoid accidental booking.

## Operational tips

- Keep notes/destination fields specific to reduce follow-up messages.
- Use week/timeline for conflict detection; list view for chronological auditing.

## If Something Fails

### Reservation save fails

- Verify required fields and non-overlapping time range.
- Refresh schedule and retry in case of recent concurrent edits.

### Wrong aircraft/time updated

- Open edited block immediately and correct it.
- Post a quick broadcast if pilots may already be affected.

### Maintenance hold not blocking bookings

- Reopen block and verify it was saved with maintenance status.
- Confirm you are in the correct club context.
