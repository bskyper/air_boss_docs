# Reservations Control

Use admin **Schedule** to manage club-wide reservation operations.

## Views and controls

- Timeline or list view
- Day-range window controls
- Date navigation (previous/today/next)
- Club-scoped context from active club selector

## What admins can do

- Create new reservation blocks
- Edit existing reservations
- Cancel reservations
- Add maintenance blocks directly on schedule
- Monitor pending approvals and maintenance holds

## Recommended workflow

1. Set active club.
2. Select time range and date window.
3. Review pending and maintenance counts.
4. Resolve conflicts before creating new blocks.
5. Use maintenance blocks to reserve downtime and avoid accidental booking.

## Operational tips

- Keep notes/destination fields specific to reduce follow-up messages.
- Use week/timeline for conflict detection; list view for chronological auditing.
