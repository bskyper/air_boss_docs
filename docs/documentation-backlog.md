# Documentation Backlog

This page tracks the user-guide buildout across mobile and web.

## Status

- ✅ Initial IA and sidebar structure created
- ✅ Core pages started for mobile pilot flows
- ✅ Core pages started for web pilot flows
- ✅ Core pages started for web admin flows
- ⏳ Deep task-level walkthroughs still needed
- ⏳ Screenshots and annotated UI still needed

## Priority 0 (Write Next)

- Mobile:
  - Full reservation lifecycle with examples (create, edit, cancel, conflicts)
  - Flight lifecycle walkthrough with screenshots (start, end, squawk handoff)
  - Profile + document upload/expiration update walkthrough
- Web pilot:
  - Schedule walkthrough (week/month, filters, edit own reservation)
  - Flights + All Flights usage guide (flags, discrepancies, maintenance flight marker)
  - Squawks reporting + filtering + attachments flow
- Web admin:
  - Users and pending approvals (role changes, status changes, document review)
  - Messaging broadcast workflow (push + comms feed behavior)
  - Billing and hold-state recovery flow

## Priority 1

- Aircraft details/read-only vs editable behavior by role
- Reports guide with interpretation tips (usage, oil trends, squawk trends)
- Club management guide (club profile, credentials, required docs, maintenance settings)
- Troubleshooting guides by platform (auth, club access, schedule issues, stale data)

## Priority 2

- FAQ refresh aligned to current product behavior
- Release notes process + template updates with real entries
- Glossary for aviation and app-specific terms

## Authoring Standards

- Write for tasks, not features
- Keep role-scoped callouts:
  - `Member`
  - `Admin`
- Use short steps with expected outcomes
- Add "What to do if it fails" for high-friction actions
- Add screenshots for every multi-step flow
