# Flights (Web Pilot)

The web pilot workspace has two flight views:

- **My Flights** — flights tied to your pilot account
- **All Flights** — all flights in the active club

## My Flights

Use this page to:

- Review your latest logs
- Log new flights
- Track Hobbs/Tach discrepancies
- Mark maintenance flights
- Enter landing counts (if enabled per aircraft)

## All Flights

Use this page for club-wide visibility:

- Filter by tail number, pilot, date range
- Filter for discrepancy/squawk-flagged flights
- Review tach/hobbs values and billing basis

## Tips

- Ensure your active club is correct before interpreting totals.
- Use **All Flights** for reconciliation and trend review; use **My Flights** for personal log entry and correction.
