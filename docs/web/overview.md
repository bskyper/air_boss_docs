The web app is especially useful for admins:

- **Dashboard** — Operations snapshot

## Browser Support

Air Boss works best on:

## Mobile Responsive

The web app is fully responsive and works on tablets and phones, though we recommend the native mobile apps for the best experience on smaller screens.
