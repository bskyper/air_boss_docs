# Aircraft (Web Pilot)

The pilot **Aircraft** page is read-oriented and optimized for preflight planning.

## What you can view

- Tail number and aircraft status
- Make/model and photos
- Maintenance warning chips (due/overdue indicators)
- Billing method/rate metadata
- Linked documents (POH, W&B, cheat sheet)

## What members can edit

Pilot users generally cannot change aircraft master data. Contact admins for updates.

## Role notes

- Member: read-only operational reference
- Admin: full aircraft management lives in admin workspace (`/dashboard/aircraft`)
