# Flight Operations (Mobile)

This guide covers the in-app flow to start and complete flights.

## Start a Flight

1. Open your reservation or aircraft.
2. Tap **Start Flight**.
3. Confirm start values:
   - Hobbs start (if tracked for the aircraft)
   - Tach start
   - Starting oil and oil added
4. Optional:
   - Mark **time discrepancy** if panel values needed manual correction
   - Mark **maintenance flight** for MX reposition/maintenance ops
5. Submit.

## Complete a Flight

1. Open active flight.
2. Tap **End Flight**.
3. Enter:
   - Hobbs end (if tracked)
   - Tach end
   - Landing count (for aircraft configured to track landings)
4. Add squawk if needed.
5. Submit to close the flight log.

## Maintenance Flight Behavior

If a flight is marked as maintenance, the app can prompt you to immediately log a separate personal flight after completion.

## Common Validation Rules

- End times must be greater than or equal to start times.
- Required fields vary by aircraft billing/tracking setup.
- Landing count may be required for specific aircraft settings.
