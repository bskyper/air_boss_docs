# Mobile Navigation

Air Boss mobile uses five primary tabs:

- **Tower** — home snapshot (weather, fleet status, upcoming reservations)
- **Comms** — club activity and broadcasts
- **Fleet** — aircraft list and aircraft details
- **Hangar** — club details, members, and admin club actions
- **Pilot** — your profile, documents, security, and personal settings

## Club Context

If you belong to multiple clubs, use the club switcher to change active context. Most data (aircraft, reservations, feed, members) is scoped to the currently selected club.

## Admin vs Member

- Members can use pilot workflows (reservations, flights, squawks, profile).
- Admins see additional controls under `Fleet` and `Hangar` (edit aircraft, member approvals, messaging, club management).
