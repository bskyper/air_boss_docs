If your account is still pending, you may see a dedicated **Pending Approval** screen until an admin activates your membership.

## After Approval

Once approved, you'll be able to:

- View the club's aircraft fleet
- See the flight schedule
- Book available aircraft
- Log your flights
- Report squawks

## Document Verification

Your club admin may need to verify your pilot documents before you can book aircraft. Make sure to:

1. Upload all required documents in your profile
2. Ensure documents are current and legible
3. Wait for admin verification (you'll see a ✓ when verified)

## Multiple Clubs

You can be a member of multiple clubs. Use each club's key/password to join, then use the club switcher to move between them.
